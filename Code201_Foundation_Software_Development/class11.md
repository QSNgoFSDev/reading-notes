## Video and Audio Content

- [ ] Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions <video> and <audio> elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.



- [ ] Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.



- [ ] Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

his is called fallback content â€” this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.



- [ ] Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

when a user visit website the brwser will seleet the appropriate image source from the srcset, based on the viewport width and defined size.
