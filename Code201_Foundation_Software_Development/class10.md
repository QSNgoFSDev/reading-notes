## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

- [ ] Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through

Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results


- [ ] List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

the tools to help us, instead of console log to check value everytime. they will return result of a block logic code. once at the time.

- [ ] What is the call stack?
